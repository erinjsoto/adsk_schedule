In my first role, our team operated in shifts to support the Bloomberg Help Desk (ADSK). Each member indicated their preferred shifts—morning, midday, or evening—based on their individual schedules and work-life balance. This script is designed to generate a randomized shift schedule for a standard five-day workweek. It collects team member names and their two preferred shifts, then uses the `dice-roll` package to assign shifts fairly. For privacy, the user list in this example is generated by Copilot and does not contain real names.

To run the script simply clone the repo, update user list, and run schedule.py
