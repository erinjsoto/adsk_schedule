In my first role, our team operated in shifts to support the Bloomberg Help Desk (ADSK). Each member indicated their preferred shifts—morning, midday, or evening—based on their individual schedules and work-life balance. This script is designed to generate a randomized shift schedule for a standard five-day workweek. It collects team member names and their two preferred shifts, then uses the numpy to randomly assign shifts fairly. For privacy, the user list in this example is generated by Copilot and does not contain real names.

## Project Structure

```
adsk_schedule/
├── scripts/
│   ├── schedule.py
│   └── utils.py
├── users/
│   └── users.json
├── README.md
```

- **scripts/**: Contains Python scripts for generating and managing shift schedules.
    - `schedule.py`: Main script to generate the weekly shift schedule.
    - `utils.py`: Helper functions for schedule generation and validation.
- **users/**: Stores user data.
    - `users.json`: List of team members and their preferred shifts.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Update `users/users.json` with your team members and their shift preferences.
3. Run the schedule generator:

     ```bash
     python scripts/schedule.py
     ```

4. The generated schedule will be displayed in the console or saved as specified.

## Customization

- Edit `users/users.json` to add or remove users and update their shift preferences.
- Adjust logic in `scripts/schedule.py` or `scripts/utils.py` for custom scheduling rules.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
